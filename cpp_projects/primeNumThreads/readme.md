# Threads

## Write a program that finds all the prime numbers from 2 to 1 million (inclusive). Create 4 threads to do the work

1. As you find a prime number, write it to a file called “primes.dat”.
2. After all the work is done, report the total number of primes found.
3. Each thread should also keep track of the number of primes it finds. After printing the total number of primes found, print the number of primes each thread found.
