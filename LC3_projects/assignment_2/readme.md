Objective: 
The objective of this lab assignment is to demonstrate your ability in 
 Using TRAP routines to get input from keyboard and output to the console 
 Detecting the end of user input with a newline character (x0A) 
Lab Statement: 
You will write a program in LC-3 machine code that will do the followings: 
1. Detect a user input from the keyboard and echo the input to the console 
2. Store the user input beginning at 0x3011. The first character will be stored in location 
0x3011. The second character will be stored in location 0x3012, etc. 
3. The user input will end with a return key which will be interpreted by LC-3 as a newline 
character (0x0A) 
4. Upon detecting a newline character, display the entire user input to the console. 
5. Terminate the program.
