Objective: 
The objective of this lab assignment is to demonstrate your ability in 
 Creating an array of strings using .STRINGZ 
 Using PUTS to display an element of a string array 
 Converting a user input from ASCII code to the corresponding numerical value 
Lab Statement: 
You will write a program in LC-3 assembly code that will do the followings: 
1. Display the prompt: “Please enter a number:” in the console. 
2. Read a user input from the keyboard and echo the user input to the console. 
3. Convert the user input from the ASCII code to the corresponding numerical value.
