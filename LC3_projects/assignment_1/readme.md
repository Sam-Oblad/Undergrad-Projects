Programming Assignment 1 
 
Objective: 
The objective of this lab assignment is to demonstrate your ability in 
 Moving data from memory locations to a register and vice versa; 
 Negating a positive integer; 
 Adding two numbers with both numbers stored in registers or one stored in a register 
and one being a literal; 
 Performing logical ADD, NOT, and OR operations; 
 Checking the parity of a number. 
 
Lab Statement: 
Two numbers, X and Y, are stored in memory locations 0x3050 and 0x3051 respectively. Write 
an LC-3 machine language program that does the following: 
1. Compute the sum of X and Y and place it at location 0x3052. 
2. Compute X – Y and store the result at location x3053 
3. Compute X AND Y and store the result at location 0x3054. 
4. Compute NOT(X) and store the result at location 0x3055. 
5. Compute X OR Y and store the result at location 0x3056. 
6. Compute X + 3 and store the result at location 0x3057. 
7. Computer X – 3 and store the result at location 0x3058. 
8. If X is even, place 0 at location 0x3059; otherwise, meaning if X is odd, place 1 at 
0x3059.
