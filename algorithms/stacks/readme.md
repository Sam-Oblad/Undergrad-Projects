# Project 5: A Stack Machine to Evaluate Expressions

- In this project, we will write your own Stack ADT, then use the stack to do the conversion based on pseudocode given below. Input will be from a text file, and output will be written to a text file.

# Stack ADT (stack.py)
### You will implement a Stack ADT (class Stack) that supports the following operations:

- push(item): push an item onto the stack. Size increases by 1.
- pop(): remove the top item from the stack and return it. Raise an IndexError if the stack is empty.
- top(): return the item on top of the stack without removing it. Raise an IndexError if the stack is empty.
- size(): return the number of items on the stack.
- clear(): empty the stack.

# Pseudocode For Main Program (main.py)


- Open file data.txt.
- Read an infix expression from the file.
- Display the infix expression.
- Call function in2post(expr), which you write. in2post() takes an infix expression as an input and returns an equivalent postfix expression as a string. If the expression is not valid, raise a SyntaxError. If the parameter expr is not a string, raise a ValueError.
- Display the postfix expression
- Call function eval_postfix(expr), which you write. eval_postfix() takes a postfix string as input and returns a number. If the expression is not valid, raise a SyntaxError.
- Display the result of eval_postfix().
# Output MUST match the example below. THIS INCLUDES WHITESPACE AND PUNCTUATION.

# Pseudocode
- Evaluate a Postfix Expression
- Initialize a stack.
### If next input is a number:
- Read the next input and push it onto the stack.
### Else:
- Read the next character, which is an operator symbol.
- Use top and pop to get the two numbers off the top of the stack.
- Combine these two numbers with the operation.
- Push the result onto the stack.
- Go to #2 while there is more of the expression to read.
- There should be one element on the stack, which is the result. Return it.
## Infix to Postfix Pseudocode
- Initialize stack to hold operation symbols and parenthesis.
### If the next input is a left parenthesis:
- Read the left parenthesis and push it onto the stack.
- else if the next input is a number or operand:
- Read the operand (or number) and write it to the output.
### else if the next input is an operator:
-  while (stack is not empty AND stack's top is not left parenthesis AND stack's top is an operation with equal or higher precedence than the next input symbol):
- Print the stack's top.
- Pop the stack's top.
- Push the next operation symbol onto the stack.
- else:
- Read and discard the next input symbol (should be a right parenthesis).
- Print the top operation and pop it.
- while stack's top is not a left parenthesis:
- Print next symbol on stack and pop stack.
- Pop and discard the last left parenthesis.
- Go to #2 while there is more of the expression to read.
- Print and pop any remaining operations on the stack.
- There should be no remaining left parentheses.
